Q1: Why might we consider using Git? 

Answer: Git enables teams to collaborate efficiently by tracking changes to code over a period of time. It gives its users version control, allowing them to revert to earlier versions, supports branching for future work, and makes merging code contributions much more manageable in projects where more than one person is working on it.  

Q2: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Answer: Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code locally while GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git's repositories and allows for collaboration, issue tracking, and pull requests. 

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches by creating a new “merge commit” that includes changes from both branches. Rebasing rewrites the commit history by redoing your feature branch commits on top of another branch which creates a cleaner history without all of the merge commits.
