Q1: Why might we consider using Git? 

Answer: Git enables teams to collaborate efficiently by tracking changes to code over a period of time. It gives its users version control, allowing them to revert to earlier versions, supports branching for future work, and makes merging code contributions much more manageable in projects where more than one person is working on it.  

Q2: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Answer: Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code locally while GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git's repositories and allows for collaboration, issue tracking, and pull requests.
